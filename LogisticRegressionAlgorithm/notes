1.  Lecture 1

Logistic Regression is primarily used for classification problems while Linear
Regression is used for predicting the values. We cant use linear regression for classification
problems as it gives you continuous values.

The decision boundary is a boundary where all values to one side belong to one class and
all the values to the other class belong to the other class

The decision boundary can be a linear or non linear decision boundary

Why Linear Regression cant be used for classification ?

1. Few outliers, will make our model inefficient
2. Also, it gives continuous values as output which is not needed for the classification 
problems. i.e it will give values where some will be less than 0 and some greater than 1 but
for classification problem we require predicted value to be between 0 and 1.

Logistic Regression Algorithm : Its a classification Algorithm

Sigmoid Function: S(x) = 1 / 1 + (e^(-x)) 

So, As x -> - infinity
		e ^ (-x) -> Infinity
		and S(x) -> 0
	
	As, x -> Infinity
		e ^ (-x) -> - infinity which equals 0
		So s(x) -> 1

In logistic regression, the output say h(x) will be 

h(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-g(x)))
 where g(x) = m * x + c // linear regression line

 cost function:
 
 Convex Function: One having only 1 local minima
 
 We want a cost function which is a convex function such that we only have one local minima.
 This is the reason we cant use the cost function from linear regression as there we have
 many local minimas
 
4. Multi Class Logistic Regression:

There are two ways to handle this:
A. one vs rest approach : Here the classes are independent of each other and each class has
its own model
B. Multinomial: Here all the classes are considered as dependent and we only have one model
and the class with highest probability is chosen as the output

5. Finding complex boundaries

In L2 Regularization, we do the square of parameters
In L1 Regularization, we take the modulus of parameters
