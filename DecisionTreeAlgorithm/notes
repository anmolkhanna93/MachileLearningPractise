Decision Trees

1. We will be using a greedy approach for our algorithm at each step to determine the
best feature to split upon. There are many different metrics that we can use for our purpose,
like accuracy, information gain, Gain ratio, Gini Index

2. Now, if instead of discrete values, we have a continuous set of values for our features,
how do we tackle them. We need to have some way of categorizing the values, that is values 
less than threshold belong to one category and values greater than threshold belong to the
other category
