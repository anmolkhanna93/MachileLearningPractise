LinearRegression

1. Not a very useful also for classification but good for predicting continuous value spectrum

2. So if we have 3 input features x1, x2 and x3 and output is y

Then our function will be something like y = m1x1 + m2 x2 + m3 x3 + b

b is a constant

So they are linearly dependent and also we can change how much dependent they are by varying the values of m1, m2 and m3 and b
 
3.
From the training data, we need a way to calculate m1, m2, m3, m4 and b

Common error measure forms: 
Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test, also known in statistics as classification function.

Median absolute deviation

If the value of any regression coefficient is zero, then two variables are: independent
