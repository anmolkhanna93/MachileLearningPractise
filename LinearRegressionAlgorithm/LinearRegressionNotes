LinearRegression

1. Not a very useful also for classification but good for predicting continuous value spectrum

2. So if we have 3 input features x1, x2 and x3 and output is y

Then our function will be something like y = m1x1 + m2 x2 + m3 x3 + b

b is a constant

So they are linearly dependent and also we can change how much dependent they are by varying the values of m1, m2 and m3 and b
 
3.
From the training data, we need a way to calculate m1, m2, m3, m4 and b

Common error measure forms: 
Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test, also known in statistics as classification function.

Median absolute deviation

If the value of any regression coefficient is zero, then two variables are: independent

Coefficient of determination

Till now to determine how good or bad the algorithm is performing, we were
Just drawing a line to see how the points are scattered.This is not a good approach.
We need some way of objectively coming to a conclusion, say some score. For this purpose, 
We will be using Coefficient of determination.

Its given as score = 1 - (u/v)
Where u is Sum((Y(True) - Y(Prdeicted))^2) for all the data points
      v is sum((Y(True)- Mean(Y(True)))^2)

This ensures that the score is between 0 and 1.It can be negative also and higher the score the better.

The above expression basically mean we are comparing the error with the worst possible scenario that we assume that for all input X the output is mean(Y(True)). Then in this case u and v will become equal and the score will be 0. Which is the worst case

The score will be negative when we are doing the predictions worst than the mean because then u > v

tHe best case is when y(predicted) = y(True), the score will be 1
